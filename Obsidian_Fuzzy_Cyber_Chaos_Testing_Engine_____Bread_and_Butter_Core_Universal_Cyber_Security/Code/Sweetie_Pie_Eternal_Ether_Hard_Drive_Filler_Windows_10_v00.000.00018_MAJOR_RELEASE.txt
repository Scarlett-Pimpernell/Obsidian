#I was going to release an executable for the C++ program below... I initially thought the better of it!... But there is no point in wasting an opportunity for perfectly viable code to be used purely for educative purposes, and only in a computer science cybersecurity class / lab at university.
#Alternatively, this program could be used to bit purge a hard drive after having deleted all personal files (Non Operating System Default Files, Added By the User Since First OS Install)... You would also need to remove the page file before running the program... HOWEVER!!!... Be aware that although most hard drive bits would be purged, there would still remain certain OS artefacts, as well as some minor bit gaps or imperfectly purged edge cases.
#If you are using this program as a hard drive bit purger, please be aware of the following: If you have a very large hard drive (e.g. bigger than 80TB), then you will need to copy this program into an appropriate number of folders to cover the total size of your hard drive (say 80TB per folder), and kick off one full execution of the program from each program copy, in each folder.
