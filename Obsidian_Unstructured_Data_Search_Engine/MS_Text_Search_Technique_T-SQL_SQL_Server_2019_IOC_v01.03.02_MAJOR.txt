--MS Text Search Technique
--T-SQL
--SQL Server 2019
--Initial Operating Capability
--Version 1.3


--OVERVIEW:
--The current algorithm takes a search text variable,
--splits the search text variable into a table variable using space delimiters,
--cross references the table variable to multiple element type tables using a join construct,
--assigns a whole match score column value based on the repository elements' name's whole match likeness,
--assigns a typo match score column value based on the repository elements' name's extended typo match likeness,
--assigns a fragment match score column value based on the repository elements' name's fragment match likeness,
--assigns a fragment purposym match score column value based on the repository elements' name's machine learning fragment purposym match likeness,
--assigns a word/phrase synonym split match score column value based on the repository elements' name's word/phrase synonym split match likeness,
--assigns a length score column value based on the repository elements' name's length unlikeness,
--assigns an aggregate score column value based on all of the score column values,
--filters the aggregate score column by a score threshold variable,
--and finally orders by optimal cascading of the values in the score columns.

--USAGE DIRECTIONS:
--This algorithm should be used in Microsoft SQL Server 2019.
--Don't forget to include the desired search text variable delimiter, and element tables, with their corresponding name columns, into the appropriate query blocks below.
--Turning on the full text indexing feature may significantly speed up query execution time. I will investigate this at a much later date.

--Integrate Automatic Digital Enterprise Twin Algorithm --> Estimated Release: H1 2021.

--TESTING:
--Optimise indexes on referenced tables.
--Optimise query execution plan For compute efficiency.
--Check query for protection against SQL injection attacks... make sure the parameter is bound properly.
--Check production environment algorithm performance, on big-data scale (millions of search elements) or hyper-data scale (billions of search elements).

--NOTA BENE:
--The ideal production use case for this algorithm includes the caching of a core set of common search text variables.
--This search algorithm excludes search operator functionality, but including search operators would be a relatively simple change if a specific client asked for this requirement.
--The word/phrase synonym and fragment purposym techniques must be used together in order to attain greatest effectiveness. Otherwise, if you just used a word/phrase synonym table, the algorithm would not understand search word/phrase context i.e. whether particular sub-phrases or words of your search query are intended as adjectives, nouns, or verbs etc.
