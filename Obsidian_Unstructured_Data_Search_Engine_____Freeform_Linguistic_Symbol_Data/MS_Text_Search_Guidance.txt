The latest files include a technique for fragment purposym and semantic associate matching within the search engine algorithm. Run the appropriate queries on your SQL Server 2019 database, using either SSMS or Visual Studio 2019. Set-up steps include: 1.Execute the MS_Text_Search_Purposym_And_Semantic_Associate_Thesauruses_Integration_T-SQL_SQL_Server_2019_IOC_v01.03.13_MAJOR.txt query (once you have sourced a representative set of important enterprise Text files and/or Microsoft Word documents); 2.Finally execute the MS_Text_Search_Technique_T-SQL_SQL_Server_2019_IOC_v01.03.02_MAJOR.txt query. The results should display in the appropriate panel. If you're feeling brave, consider integrating these steps into your existing or new product/service/experience, but bare in mind that there will be incremental changes going forward.
