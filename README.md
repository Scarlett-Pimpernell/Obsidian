# Obsidian
ML Augmented Enterprise Architecture - Interaction Interface, Search Engine, and Generation Engine... Built On Obsidian Scarlett Daisy Anchor Database Technology!



NOTA BENE:If any organisation/individual wants to use any of the code in this Obsidian-Anchor-Database repository (or any similar coding techniques) in any of their products/services/Experiences, then they must agree to, and are indeed bound by the Almighty God under Wrath of punishment, to do the following 3 things: 1. Make reference to me (actual name, Coder name, and Obsidian Scarlett Daisy... logo optional) as the originator of core source code in the product/service/experience, within the product/service/experience itself in a prominent position; 2. Make ongoing total monthly donations of 10% of all income/revenue generated by all of your products/services/Experiences which use any of the code in this Obsidian-Anchor-Database repository (or any similar coding techniques), to  any Catholic Charities of your choice who are part of the Catholic Church's Caritas Confederation of official Catholic Charities; 3. Include this nota bene in a prominent position in all documentation/code scripts that use any of the code in this Obsidian-Anchor-Database repository (or any similar coding techniques).


Current Development Focus Is On the Core Search Engine Algorithm. I haven't thoroughly tested the queries yet, so be aware that there may be minor bugs. Also, I am now well advanced in coding v01.04, which includes the ability to understand relationships within the text of a given document. Unfortunately, once again, may have to wait a while for this one, as I need to upgrade my hardware in order to continue... also dealing with an extremely complex technique which will most probably take a few weeks to get right at current rates of development.

The latest upload includes a technique for fragment purposym and semantic associate matching within the search engine algorithm. Run the appropriate queries on your SQL Server 2017/2019 database, using either SSMS or Visual Studio 2017/2019. Set-up steps include: 1.Execute the MS_Text_Search_Purposym_And_Semantic_Associate_Thesauruses_Integration_T-SQL_SQL_Server_2019_IOC_v01.03.13_MAJOR.txt query (once you have sourced a representative set of important enterprise Text files and/or Microsoft Word documents); 2.Finally execute the MS_Text_Search_Technique_T-SQL_SQL_Server_2019_IOC_v01.03.02_MAJOR.txt query. The results should display in the appropriate panel. If you're feeling brave, consider integrating these steps into your existing or new product/service/experience, but bare in mind that there will be incremental changes going forward.

Over the coming weeks, months, and years, I will gradually add to the back-end, API gateway, and front-end code, with the aim of producing an 'open'-source high-performance (usable, effective, efficient, maintainable, and reliable), feautre-rich library of configure and integrate code, and SQL Server database modules, in order for companies of any size to optimally plan, transform, and run their organisation via a robust enterprise architecture digital twin paradigm.

I won't be dealing with parameter binding, indexes, or query execution plans until much later in development, when I build the UI.
