Intelligent Enterprise Architecture - Human Interaction Interface, Search Engine, and Artificial Intelligence Agent.

I have finally picked up the coding hobby again, found some suitable hardware to work with, and now intend to code non-stop for the forseeable future.

Current Development Focus Is On the Core Search Engine Algorithm.

The latest upload includes a technique for generic synonym matching within the search engine algorithm. Run the appropriate queries on your SQL Server 2017/2019 database, using either SSMS or Visual Studio 2017/2019. Set-up steps include: 1.Execute the create schema and import data queries; 2.Execute the thesaurus_integration query or the test_thesaurus_load query depending on your hardware, and how quickly you want to get to developing yourself; 3.Finally execute the text_search_algorithm query. The results should display in the appropriate panel.

Over the coming weeks and months, I will gradually add to the back-end, middle-services, and front-end code, with the aim of producing an open-source high-performance, feautre-rich stack of configure and integrate code and applications, in order for companies of any size to optimally plan, transform, and run their organisation via a robust enterprise architecture paradigm.
