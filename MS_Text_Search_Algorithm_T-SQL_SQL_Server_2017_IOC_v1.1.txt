--HEADER:
--MS Text Search Algorithm
--T-SQL
--SQL Server 2017
--Initial Operating Capability
--Version 1.1


--OVERVIEW:
--The current algorithm takes a search text variable,
--splits the search text variable into a table variable using space delimiters,
--cross references the table variable to multiple element type tables using a join construct,
--assigns a whole match score column value based on the repository elements' name's whole match likeness,
--assigns a slide match score column value based on the repository elements' name's extended slide match likeness (for typo handling),
--assigns a split match score column value based on the repository elements' name's split match likeness,
--assigns a generic synonym match score column value based on the repository elements' name's generic synonym match likeness,
--assigns a length score column value based on the repository elements' name's length unlikeness,
--assigns an aggregate score column value based on all of the basic score column values,
--filters the aggregate score column by a score threshold variable,
--and finally orders by optimal cascading of the values in the basic score columns.

--USAGE DIRECTIONS:
--This algorithm should be used in Microsoft SQL Server 2017.
--Don't forget to include the desired search text variable delimiters, and element tables,
--with their corresponding name columns, into the appropriate query blocks below.
--Turning on the full text indexing feature may significantly speed up query execution time.

--FUNCTIONALITY STILL TO BE INCLUDED IN THE ALGORITHM INCLUDES:
--Integrate A Client Enterprise Specific Phrase Inferencing Technique --> Estimated Release: 1st Nov 2019.
--Integrate A Client Enterprise Specific Synonym Matching Technique --> Estimated Release: 8th Nov 2019.
--Dimensional Boosting By Viewed Element Network/Peers/Ancestors/Descendants --> Estimated Release: 15th Nov 2019.
--Dimensional Boosting By Epoch Network/Peers/Ancestors/Descendants --> Estimated Release: 22nd Nov 2019.
--Dimensional Boosting By User Segment Groups --> Estimated Release: 2nd Jan 2020.
--Biomimicry Technique --> Estimated Release: 5th May 2020.

--TESTING:
--Optimise Query For Compute Efficiency.
--Optimise indexes on referenced tables.
--Check Query For Protection Against SQL Injection Attacks.
--Check Production Environment Algorithm Performance, On Big-Data Scale (Millions Of Search Elements) Or Hyper-Data Scale (Billions Of Search Elements).

--NOTA BENE:
--The ideal production use case for this algorithm includes the caching of a core set of common search text variables.
--If this query runs too slowly on your available hardware, consider using only the aggregate score column for ordering. This would be effectively sub-optimal, yet more efficient.
--This search algorithm excludes search operator functionality, but including search operators would be a relatively simple change if a specific client asked for this requirement.
